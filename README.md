# RoutingProject
The goal of this project was to implement a network of routers and machines that  are able to communicate through their links. Functionality required includes finding the shortest path using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, creating routing tables for  routers, using Max heap priority queue for sending messages between machines.
